# Petro Lithology Prediction 

Petro-Lithology-Prediction is a machine learning-based project aimed at predicting the lithology (rock type) of subsurface formations using well log data. The goal is to develop accurate models that can classify the rock type encountered in oil and gas wells, which is crucial for hydrocarbon exploration and reservoir characterization. 

The project utilizes various supervised learning techniques, such as decision trees, random forests, and neural networks, to build predictive models from a comprehensive well log dataset. The models will be trained to map the relationships between the well log measurements (e.g., porosity, density, resistivity) and the corresponding lithology labels.

The developed models will provide valuable insights into the subsurface geology and help optimize drilling and completion operations, improve reservoir management, and enhance hydrocarbon recovery efficiency. This project contributes to the advancement of data-driven approaches in the oil and gas industry."

This description highlights the key aspects of the project, including the use of machine learning for lithology prediction, the importance of the task for the oil and gas industry, and the potential benefits of the developed models.
